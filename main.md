So i have quite a few ideas and when i saw this one i figure id play around with my idea i want for a game id like to build but have no real skills or money to do it myself. I practically use AI for all my coding now days even though i spent 2 years learning to code on my own which just feels like im cheating these days since i use the AI so much lol.

So of course with AI i played out a scenario for my idea. Theres more to this one idea but hopefully it makes sense and isnt to laughable or useless to at least consider. The short version: Its an api idea to seamlessly build lightning into apps and games where in game credits or points can be directly scanned into bitcoin lightning wallets. I thought of building it into a zombie apolcolypse game someday as an easter egg. XD....Not sure if i will ever be able to do such a thing so hopefully someone steals the idea and makes it possible. Its my way imagining how we can secretly orange pill the world little by little lol.

The Long Version, imagined as a shark tank presentation you are watching:

## Where Your Investment Goes: Building the Future of Lightning Points

Alright, let’s talk about what your money does for Lightning Points. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is already up and running—folks are using nodes on Raspberry Pis with tools like Umbrel, proving the tech works. But it’s not ready for the big leagues yet. It’s not built for Xbox, PlayStation, or the app you use to check in at the airport. That’s where your investment comes in.

We’re asking for **$500,000** to create a suite of **platform-specific software modules** that make Lightning Points a no-brainer for any company or device to adopt. These modules will let platforms run lightweight Bitcoin Lightning Network nodes in the background, handling self-custodial point transactions without users—or even the platforms—needing to understand the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin. Our goal? Make it so seamless that users don’t even realize they’re using Bitcoin, just points that work everywhere. And here’s a game-changer: we’ve already partnered with **Bitrefill**, giving Lightning Points instant access to over 5,000 products globally—from gift cards to mobile top-ups—through their Bitcoin Lightning Network integrations, making this even more convenient for users right out of the gate.

Here’s how we’ll spend the money:

### 1. Dedicated Software for Gaming Platforms
Picture Xbox or PlayStation jumping on Lightning Points, letting gamers earn points in one game and spend them in another—or gift them to a buddy. Right now, they’d have to build a whole Bitcoin Lightning system themselves, which is a headache. We’re taking that pain away.

- **What We’ll Build**: Custom software modules for gaming consoles, turning each one into a lightweight Bitcoin Lightning node. These handle point transactions (really satoshis) instantly and securely.
- **Why It Matters**: It’s plug-and-play. Big players like Microsoft or Sony just drop in our code, and Lightning Points go live. No Bitcoin expertise needed.
- **User Impact**: Gamers get a point system they actually own—not controlled by the platform. It feels like in-game currency but works across games and beyond, even on Bitrefill’s 5,000+ products.

Your investment pays for coding these console modules, testing them to handle millions of transactions, and optimizing for low-resource environments.

### 2. Seamless Lightning Wallets for Mobile Apps
Now think about airports, airlines, or social media apps using Lightning Points for loyalty programs or quick payments. Most users are on their phones, and they’re not Bitcoin experts. We’ll make it stupidly easy for them.

- **What We’ll Build**: Lightweight Bitcoin Lightning wallets that act as light nodes, built for iOS and Android. Users can earn, spend, or share points with a tap, all while holding their own keys.
- **Why It Matters**: Companies like airports can embed this into their apps with a simple API. Our software hides the Bitcoin Lightning Network’s complexity, so their devs don’t need to start from scratch.
- **User Impact**: Imagine a traveler earning points on a flight, then using them to buy a Starbucks gift card via Bitrefill or topping up their phone—all in seconds, without knowing it’s Bitcoin tech powering it.

The funds will fuel these wallet apps, prioritizing ironclad security, massive scalability, and a user experience smoother than their favorite payment app.

### 3. Partnership Power with Bitrefill
Our partnership with Bitrefill is a massive win. They’re the biggest commercial player on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, offering access to over 5,000 products like gift cards, mobile refills, and eSIMs across 170+ countries.

- **What We’ll Build**: Enhanced integrations to make Bitrefill’s catalog a native part of the Lightning Points experience. Our software will let users spend points directly on Bitrefill’s products, whether they’re on a gaming console or a mobile app.
- **Why It Matters**: Platforms adopting Lightning Points instantly tap into Bitrefill’s global marketplace, boosting user engagement without extra work.
- **User Impact**: Users can turn points into real-world value—like an Amazon gift card or phone credit—anywhere in the world, making points feel like universal cash.

Part of your investment will strengthen this integration, ensuring it’s fast, reliable, and invisible to users.

### 4. The Breakdown: How the Money Gets Spent
- **Development Costs ($300,000)**: Covers our team of engineers building console modules, mobile wallets, and Bitrefill integrations. We’re crafting custom code optimized for each platform to run lightweight Bitcoin Lightning nodes efficiently.
- **Testing & Security ($100,000)**: We’ll stress-test for millions of transactions and hire top security auditors. Self-custody means we can’t skimp on safety.
- **Rollout & Support ($100,000)**: Funds early partnerships with platforms like a game studio or airport app, plus ongoing support to scale as more jump on board.

### Why This Wins
- **For Platforms**: Dead-simple integration with access to Bitrefill’s 5,000+ products. They get cutting-edge Bitcoin tech and new revenue streams without the hassle.
- **For Users**: Total freedom. They own their points, use them across ecosystems—or on Bitrefill’s global catalog—without friction. It’s like cash, but better.
- **For Us**: Your investment makes Lightning Points *the* solution for platforms ditching centralized points, with Bitrefill’s marketplace as a massive value-add.

The Bitcoin Lightning Network is fast and cheap—your $500,000 makes it **universal, invisible, and insanely convenient**. We’re not just coding software; we’re paving the way for Bitcoin to power everyday life. That’s the deal you’re in on.

I was commenting on a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1les1mc/what_are_your_nonprofit_app_ideas/) earlier and cannot post the rest of the idea so here is a more user friendly version of the investment portion since im already committed to this idea of mine lol....it could still be non-profit of course and im sure if you are a good developer you can get plenty people in the Bitcoin space to support instead of dealing with the shark tank traditionalists.

## Building Decentralized IDs with Lightning Points

Centralized logins for games, social media, or airport apps trap your data, points, and maybe soon a social credit score. Lightning Points breaks that mold, and a third of our $500,000 ask will turn every account into a **decentralized digital ID** using **LNURL**, a Bitcoin Lightning protocol, to redefine online identity.

LNURL lets users sign into platforms with their Bitcoin Lightning wallet, acting as a secure digital ID they control—no corporate middleman. They can build a social profile tied to points earned from gaming, posting, or travel, and spend them anywhere, including on **Bitrefill’s 5,000+ products** like gift cards and phone top-ups worldwide.

A third of your investment will:
- **Build a Simple API**: Create a plug-and-play API, easier than Google login, so platforms like social media, games, or airlines can add LNURL logins and Lightning Points effortlessly.
- **Drive Standardization**: Partner with wallets like Alby and Breez to make LNURL the standard for logins, letting anyone with a Bitcoin Lightning wallet join and create a profile with 2FA options like Aegis Authenticator, YubiKey devices, or passkeys based on unique devices, not just mobile or email.
- **Create a Seamless Experience**: Design an intuitive UX where users don’t realize it’s Bitcoin—just a fast way to log in, manage points, and use them freely.

### Why It’s a Winner
- **For Platforms**: A secure, engaging login system with Bitrefill’s marketplace access, boosting user retention.
- **For Users**: True ownership of IDs and points, protected by flexible, secure 2FA, free from centralized control.
- **For Us**: Positions Lightning Points as the gateway to a decentralized future, where social credits and logins are user-owned.

This investment makes LNURL the key to a world where your digital identity and value are yours, not a corporation’s.
